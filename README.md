🐉 Loong Project is a collaborative effort to explore whether reasoning-capable models can bootstrap themselves from small, high-quality **seed datasets** by generating synthetic data and verifying LLM agent responses.

## 🔍 What's in this Repo?

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/loongdiagram.png" alt="Project Loong Agent-Environment Loop" width="75%">
</div>

> **Agent-Environment Loop**: Project Loong leverages a feedback mechanism where a Generator creates synthetic Q&A, a Verifier evaluates answers, and a Trainable Agent learns iteratively — enabling scalable, self-improving reasoning systems.


#### 1. 📊 **Seed Datasets** — Real, human-vetted data from computable domains like math, physics, finance, etc.
#### 2. 📘 **Cookbooks** — Modular scripts for synthetic data generation, verification, and RL training loops.

<br>

## 📊 Seed Datasets [→](./data)
A collection of **seed datasets**, structured for generation and verification, divded for each domain. 

Each datapoint includes:
- `question`
- `final_answer`
- `rationale` (typically code)
- `metadata` (license, source, domain, difficulty, tags, anything else)

Each dataset is designed to allow automatic evaluation via **verifiers**, usually by executing the rationale code and comparing the output to the known answer.

###  Dataset Overview

The repository currently includes a total of **3,551 questions** spanning **8 diverse domains** (and growing!):

- 🧮 **Advanced Math:** 1,615 questions  
- ⚛️ **Advanced Physics:** 434 questions   
- 🧬 **Computational Biology:** 304 questions  
- 💹 **Finance:** 320 questions  
- 📈 **Graph & Discrete Math:** 179 questions  
- 🧠 **Logic:** 110 questions  
- 📐 **Mathematical Programming:** 68 questions   
- 🔒 **Security & Safety:** 521 questions

We have combined all the datasets into a single file: `data/all_seed_dataset.json`. You can also find each domain's dataset in the corresponding folder. 

> [!TIP]
> Want to contribute your own? See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](data/CONTRIBUTING.md) for seed datasets.

<br>

## 📘 Cookbooks [→](./cookboos)
Reusable scripts and notebooks for:

- Few-shot prompting from seed data
- Generating synthetic questions, rationales, and answers
- Running verifiers over generations
- Exporting datasets for supervised fine-tuning or RL

These pipelines allow you to condition generations on real data, verify outputs, and build consistent synthetic traces.
