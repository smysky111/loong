The distance between two vertices is the minimum number of edges that need to be traversed to connect them.\\n\\n### Step 3: Calculate Distances Between Vertices\\nSince each vertex in a tetrahedral graph is connected directly to every other vertex, we can evaluate the distances:\\n- Distance between \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\): **1** (they are directly connected)\\n- Distance between \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\): **1** (they are directly connected)\\n- Distance between \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\): **1** (they are directly connected)\\n- Distance between \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\): **1** (they are directly connected)\\n- Distance between \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\): **1** (they are directly connected)\\n- Distance between \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\): **1** (they are directly connected)\\n\\n### Step 4: Find the Maximum Distance\\nSince all pairs of vertices are directly connected, the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in this graph is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Maximum Distance} = 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Step 5: Determine the Diameter\\nSince no pair of vertices has a distance greater than 1, the diameter of the Tetrahedral Graph is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Diameter} = 1\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe diameter of a Platonic Tetrahedral Graph is therefore:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{1}\\n\\\\]\", 'verification_result': VerificationResult(status=<VerificationOutcome.SUCCESS: 'success'>, result='1', duration=0.0004470348358154297, timestamp=datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 1, 13, 28, 17, 138596), metadata={'attempt': 1}, error_message=None), 'state': DataPoint(question='For a Platonic Tetrahedral Graph, what is the diameter of the graph?', final_answer='1', rationale='import networkx as nx\\n\\nG = nx.tetrahedral_graph()\\nprint(nx.diameter(G))', metadata={'synthetic': 'True', 'created': '2025-04-01T13:25:47.394576', 'generator': 'few_shot'}), 'rewards_dict': {'correctness': 10.0}})\n"
